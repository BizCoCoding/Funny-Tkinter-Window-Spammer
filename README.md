# Tkinter Window Spammer

This code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) with the Tkinter library in Python. It creates a main window with the title "a" and dimensions "350x350" at a random position on the user's screen. It also defines two functions, open_new_window and open_new_window2, which create two additional windows with the title "a" and dimensions "900x900" at random positions on the user's screen. The windows are created with a blue background color. The window.after() method is used to schedule the two functions to run repeatedly, with a delay of 500 milliseconds between each run. Finally, the mainloop() method is called on the main window to start the GUI event loop.
